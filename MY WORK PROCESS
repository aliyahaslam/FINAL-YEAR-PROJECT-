I will be writing down what I have been doing. 
Firstly, I added all my files by making their respected folders.
I am now adding another folder into the first folder to add a clean data pathway where I can add the cleaned data into.
Some of the files are being cleaned manually by me making new excel documents and copying and pasting the work while others are being cleaned through google collab.
