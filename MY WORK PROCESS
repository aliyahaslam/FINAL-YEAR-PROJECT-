I will be writing down what I have been doing. 
Firstly, I added all my files by making their respected folders.
I am now adding another folder into the first folder to add a clean data pathway where I can add the cleaned data into.
Some of the files are being cleaned manually by me making new excel documents and copying and pasting the work while others are being cleaned through google collab. 
I have cleaned most of the files manually by putting the data into a new excel file as this was much easier. 
The cleaning process for most of this was taking the years that I would be working with and all the other information on the sheet I needed.
Although I sorted out the cleaning process for the years, there are some datasets that had some rows with no values or a 0 or a null therefore the plan is to put all the datasets into google collab and make sure to check all of this.
I started to standardize all my datasets. At the start I did make the mistake of just using standard scaler which did not work with my datasets as I am not doing machine learning. That did set me back a week. 
To get myself on schedule, I looked at each dataset and tried to see what I needed to do to make the dataset easier to compare. I had to go and search up the population datasets which I created and then started to standardize the datasets that needed that.
With each dataset, I checked and saw how I would need to standardize the datasets. I needed to find population datasets that matched the months and years for example. After speaking with my supervisor, I decided to just use the estmiated population datasets and then subtract the years.
After that I would divide it by 12 (for the amount of months) and put the total number for each month. We already know that population datasets are an estimate so I was estimating the same thing still. 
After doing this, I was able to standardize all my datasets !!
I started to work on the POWERBI for the final part. Firstly, I managed to design the colours for each page of the dashboard. I decided to give each industry a different colour. 
I have now started to make the visuals for the dataset. I have completed the general economy visuals. I need to start on the comparative analysis but I would like to show my supervisor before continuing just in case it did not make sense, was not good enough. 
I have seen that I might be using more than one page for each country though. Each country can fit roughly 3/4 visuals and I feel like I can make a lot more visuals than that for each country per say. I do need to speak with my supervisor about this as well.
