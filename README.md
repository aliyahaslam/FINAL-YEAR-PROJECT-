# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT-
My final year project is a comparative analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on industries in both the UK and the USA.'
The analysis will focus on six industries :
1. Healthcare - COVID-19 cases
2. Energy - Energy Consumption
3. Trade - Imports and Exports
4. Transport - Public Transport usage, avaiation
5. Retail - Retail Sales, Tax
6. General Economy - Inflation, GDP, unemployment rates.

This final outcome of the comparative analysis will be through POWER BI where I will be making an interactive dashboard. It will show the comparisons that I have made through visualisations and storytelling.
